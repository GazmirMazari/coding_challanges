package samsara_coding_question

I had an interview with Samsara recently and was asked this problem.

//Problem:
//We're going to build the beginnings of a markdown processor. Markdown is a markup language that allows you to easily create HTML.
//We ll provide some sample input and desired output. Dont worry too much about edge cases, but feel free to ask if you re unsure or think there s something we ought to consider.
//
//Part 1:  A markdown processor is capable of handling a multitude of string to html tag formats. For now, we just want to focus on supporting <p/>, <br/>, <blockquote/>, and <del/> tags.
//
//Input:
//String input = "This is a paragraph with a soft\n" + "line break.\n\n" + "This is another paragraph that has\n" +
//"> Some text that\n" + "> is in a\n" + "> block quote.\n\n" +
//"This is another paragraph with a ~~strikethrough~~ word.";
//
//Expected Output:
//"<p>This is a paragraph with a soft<br />line break.</p>
//<p>This is another paragraph that has <br />
//<blockquote.>Some text that<br />is in a<b.r />
//block quote</blockquote.> </p> <p>This is another paragraph with a
//<del>strikethrough</del.> word.</p>"
